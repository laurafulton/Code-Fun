				<h3> Early Life</h3>
				<p> This is about my rap career. So, I am not actually Eminim. He is awesome though. I never listened to rap music until I started driving. Prior to learning to drive, country music was "my jam." However, I soon realized that country music + driving = road hazard. To stay concentrated on the road, I switched my music station to rap.  </p>
